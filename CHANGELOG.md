# Changelog

Notable changes to Code Buddy. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Users receive a change when it is
released to the `stable` branch.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Code Buddy now needs Claude Code 2.1.287 or later.** Its hooks are a
  Claude Code mod, loaded once per session: they start no process per tool
  call, where the shell hooks started Node twice for each tool call of an
  agent working on a comment. On an older Claude Code, `/code-buddy:code-buddy`
  says so and does not start (the server prints `HOOKS_MISSING`).
- The file locks live in the session, as the agents do: `lock.mjs` is gone.
  An agent waits up to 6 seconds for a file another comment's agent holds,
  then releases its locks and retries, as before.

### Added

- **The hook log**, to check what the plugin's hooks do in a real session:
  `/code-buddy-debug on` turns it on in every session, `tail -f
  ~/.cache/code-buddy/hook.log` follows it, `/code-buddy-debug` shows its last
  lines. See [Troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting).

- Claude can ask the reader a question in the thread (`ask.mjs`) instead of
  guessing; the comment waits on the reader's answer.
- A question can offer choices (`ask.mjs --option "<label>: <description>"`,
  `--multiple` to allow several): the thread shows one button per option, the
  reader can still answer in their own words, and the thread keeps what they
  chose. An agent working on a comment that calls `AskUserQuestion`, which
  only reaches the manager's terminal, is told to ask in the thread instead.

- A bubble above the start of each open comment's text, where its *Comment*
  button was: clicking it opens the comment's thread. While a comment on a
  text is being written, the text stays highlighted on the page.

- The widget shows what the agent is doing now ("Reading `App.tsx`…",
  "Thinking…") and a fuller trail: tools as they start, end or fail, the
  agent's messages, and its thinking (a summary when Claude Code provides one).

### Fixed

- A text selection across several elements (two paragraphs, list items, table
  cells) could not be commented on, and neither could text styled by CSS
  (`text-transform`) or around hidden text, a `<select>` or a `<textarea>`:
  no *Comment* button showed. The widget now quotes the page's own text. The
  *Comment* button sits above the start of the selection, not at the left of
  its whole box.
- A reader's message with a line break split the server's event line, and
  the manager read a truncated follow-up. The texts on an event line are now
  JSON strings, their line breaks escaped.
- After refusing a request body too large, the server kept the connection
  open with the rest of the body unread: the next request on it hung. It now
  closes it.
- A long current step under a comment was cut off mid-word instead of ending
  with an ellipsis, and its working dots were hidden; it now ends with one
  ellipsis, and the dots show whenever the step fits.
- An agent that claimed its comment with a relative `--project` (`--project .`
  after a `cd`) worked with no locks and no progress: the hooks now bind it to
  the project `claim.mjs` found, which it prints.
- Files outside the project (an `editable` folder such as `../api`) were
  never locked: the locks now cover the whole git repository the project is
  in, and the widget shows those files as `../api/…`.
- An agent could write files from Bash (`sed -i`, an inline Python or Node
  script, `cat >`, `tee`), where no lock covers them: agents edited the same
  file at once. The hooks now refuse those commands to an agent working on a
  comment and ask for Edit or Write, and the agent's prompt says so. A
  command whose files are all visibly outside the repository (a scratch file
  in `/tmp`) still runs.
- The file locks and the progress never worked in the agents: the hooks were
  declared in the skill, and a skill's hooks do not fire in subagents. The
  plugin now declares them, and they skip Node unless an agent works on a
  comment.
- A build that failed kept its build lock until the agent stopped.
- An agent still working after the reader stopped it recorded steps that then
  showed under the next run.
- Tools called in parallel recorded the agent's thinking and messages twice.
- A claim or an answer chained with a command that failed was ignored: the
  agent worked without file locks, or kept its locks after answering.
- A binding left by a killed agent made every Claude Code session start Node
  for each tool call; bindings silent for two hours are now ignored and pruned.
- Two processes could break the same abandoned lock on the comments file and
  both write it, losing one change.
- Claude's answers no longer carry the run's steps in `comments.json`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-29

First release.

### Added

- Install as a Claude Code plugin, straight from GitHub:
  `claude plugin marketplace add neolitec/code-buddy#stable`. The `stable`
  branch holds the released versions, with the built widget; `main` is where
  development happens.
- `/code-buddy:code-buddy [dir]` and `init [dir]` target a folder of the
  repository, such as `web`.
- A mascot drifts at the bottom of the panel, in its own strip so it never
  covers the comments. It keeps still under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and is
  hidden when the window is under 560 px tall.
- The panel's bottom-right corner shows the plugin's version and links to the
  project on GitHub.
- MIT license, contribution guide, code of conduct and security policy.

### Changed

- The widget's blues come from the mascot's body, keeping readable contrast.

### Fixed

- Hooks failed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when Code Buddy ran as a plugin.
- The floating panel squeezed the page; it now floats over it, and only the
  docked panel makes room.
- Leaving a new comment or a thread on a page without comments showed an
  empty panel; it now returns to the open comments.
- The server sent the text of its exceptions to the browser; it now answers
  with fixed messages (400 invalid JSON, 413 body too large, 500 internal
  error) and logs the details.
- The widget's API client dropped request headers passed as a `Headers` object
  or an array.
- The widget bundled React without its license notice: the notices now stay in
  `widget.js`, and `dist/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt` carries the full license of
  every bundled package.
